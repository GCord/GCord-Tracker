• You cannot use this Repo to start discussions especially for a hostile environment

• When submitting something, behave with civility and common sense

### USAGE NOTICE
Your submission may not be responded to for a while. Please be patient as I may not have enough viable information to reply with important detail. You may contact me through Discord if you believe there is something wrong.
